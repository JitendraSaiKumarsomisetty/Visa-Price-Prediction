# Visa-Price-Prediction
AI Enabled Visa Status Prediction and Processing Time Estimator
Project Statement:
Visa applicants often face long waiting times and uncertainty regarding the progress of their applications. This project aims to develop a predictive analytics system that estimates visa processing times based on historical data. By analyzing past application records—including applicant country, application type, processing office, and seasonal variations—this system will provide applicants with data-driven estimates of how long their application may take, improving transparency and applicant experience.
